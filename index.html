                <p>A growing news source with the latest updates, and analysis in decentralized finance. This project began as a twitter community that shares impactful stories that shape the ecosystem. The owner of the group decided they wanted to expand their operations into other communities and wanted the backbone of the expansion to be new branding and an interactive website.
                    <br><br> We were approached to guide in the branding and conversion of the articles into a website that allowed their small community to share headlines and grow the brand into something larger. The website displays our talent in creating interactive websites using animations and showcases the latest trends in digital design. Logo design, branding, web design, and the development of the website was entirely in our hands. </p>
